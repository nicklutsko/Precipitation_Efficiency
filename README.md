# Precipitation_Efficiency

Respository for code used in analysis of Lutsko and Cronin (2018) JAMES article on precipitation efficiency.

Contains !! datafiles from the SAM simulations, 2 sample namelist files and !! python notebooks used in the analysis.

The notebooks include:
  -
  -
  -simple_model_cloud_density calculates cloud condensate mixing ratios for plumes starting at 900hPa with an environmental relative humidity of 80% and cloud-base temperature of 288K, 290K and 292K.
